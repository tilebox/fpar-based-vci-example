- The workflow for calculating VCI involves two phases. Phase 1 consolidates MODIS and VIIRS data into a Zarr datacube on GCS using a parallel Tilebox workflow. Phase 2 will use this datacube to calculate VCI. The project structure includes a `workflow` directory for the Python workflow code and an `infrastructure` directory for the Pulumi GCP code.
- The FPAR GeoTIFF files for the VCI project are read by `rioxarray` as `xarray.DataArray` objects. They have a single 'band' dimension that should be removed (squeezed). The data is `uint8` with a scale factor of 0.01, which `rioxarray` applies automatically. The CRS is consistently EPSG:4326.
